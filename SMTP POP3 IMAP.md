Here’s a quick and clear note about **SMTP**, **POP3**, and **IMAP** protocols:


### **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Used to **send emails** from a client to a mail server or between mail servers.
- **Works on**: TCP port **25** (default), **465** (secure SMTP), or **587** (modern SMTP).
- **Role**: It ensures your email reaches the recipient's mail server.
- **Direction**: One-way communication (sending only).
- **Example**: When you press "Send" in your email app, SMTP sends the email to the recipient’s server.

### **POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)**

- **Purpose**: Used to **retrieve emails** from a mail server to a client.
- **Works on**: TCP port **110** (default) or **995** (secure POP3).
- **Role**: Downloads emails to your device and, by default, deletes them from the server.
- **Direction**: One-way communication (downloading only).
- **Limitations**:
    - Emails are stored locally, so they are not accessible from other devices after downloading.
    - Good for users who access emails on one device only.

### **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Used to **retrieve and manage emails** on a server.
- **Works on**: TCP port **143** (default) or **993** (secure IMAP).
- **Role**:
    - Synchronizes emails across multiple devices.
    - Allows viewing, organizing, and searching emails on the server without downloading them.
- **Direction**: Two-way communication (synchronizes changes between server and client).
- **Advantages**:
    - Emails stay on the server, so they’re accessible from multiple devices.
    - Better for users with multiple devices or remote email access.

- **POP3**: Downloading emails (simple, one device).
- **IMAP**: Synchronizing emails (multiple devices).
