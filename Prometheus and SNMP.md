Not exactly! Prometheus and SNMP serve different purposes, but **Prometheus can integrate with SNMP** to collect metrics.

---

### How Prometheus Uses SNMP:

- **Prometheus**: A **monitoring and alerting toolkit** primarily used to collect and store metrics from systems, applications, and devices.
- Prometheus itself doesnâ€™t rely on SNMP natively; instead, it uses an **SNMP Exporter** to bridge the gap.
- **SNMP Exporter**:
    - A tool that Prometheus uses to scrape metrics from devices supporting SNMP.
    - Translates SNMP data into Prometheus-friendly metrics.

### Key Differences:

|**Aspect**|**SNMP**|**Prometheus**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Monitor and manage network devices|Collect and store metrics from diverse sources|
|**Protocol**|Uses SNMP (UDP-based)|Uses HTTP for metric scraping|
|**Approach**|Polling model for device metrics|Pull-based scraping of metrics|

---

### Real-World Example:

- A network switch supports SNMP and provides metrics like bandwidth usage, port status, or error rates.
- Prometheus uses the **SNMP Exporter** to collect these metrics and store them for visualization or alerting in tools like **Grafana**.

---

### Summary:

- Prometheus itself doesn't "use SNMP" directly.
- It integrates with SNMP devices through the **SNMP Exporter**, making SNMP data available in Prometheus' ecosystem.
