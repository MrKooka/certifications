**Title:** Ad Hoc Mode in Wireless Networking

**Content:**  
Ad hoc mode is a decentralized wireless networking configuration where devices communicate directly without relying on a central access point or infrastructure. It is typically used for temporary or peer-to-peer networks.

Key Characteristics:

- **Infrastructure-less:** Does not require a router or access point.
- **Direct Communication:** Devices connect directly to each other.
- **Dynamic Topology:** Devices can join or leave the network at any time, often causing changes in routing paths.

**Applications:**

- Emergency communications (e.g., natural disaster zones).
- Temporary setups like meetings or file-sharing among nearby devices.
- Military operations where infrastructure may not exist or is impractical.

**Advantages:**

- Quick deployment without specialized equipment.
- Flexible and self-organizing.

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited range and scalability.
- Susceptibility to interference and security vulnerabilities.

**Connections:**

- **Wi-Fi Direct (#Networking/Wireless):** A modern implementation of ad hoc mode for direct device communication.
- **Mesh Networks (#Networking/Topology):** A more advanced concept that builds on ad hoc principles for broader coverage.

**Sources/References:**

- IEEE 802.11 Standard (Ad Hoc Mode definition).
- Use cases in disaster recovery studies.
