Network Topology Refers to the arrangement of different elements like links, nodes, clients, and servers that make up a computer network

**Physical Topology** 
Used to show how the network devices and components are physically cabled and connected together

**Logical Topology** 
Talks about how the traffic is actually going to flow in the network



**Point-to-point** 
Topology Simplest form of network topology that involves a direct connection between two devices.

**Ring Topology** 
A network configuration where each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular data path

**Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)** 
Used to conduct data transmissions on fiber optic lines in a local area network

**Bus** 
Topology All of the network devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone

**Star Topology** 
One of the most common network layouts that is in use today

**Hub-and-spoke Topology** 
A variation of the star topology where the central node (hub) is connected to multiple nodes (spokes)

**Mesh Topology** 
Features a point-to-point connection between every single device on the network to create a robust and redundant network
**A full-mesh**
Every node conected to every other node in the network 
number of connections: 
```math
x = n(n-1)/2
```
**partial-mesh.**
Partial-mesh Topology Some nodes are organized in a full mesh scheme, while others are only connected to one or two devices in the network
