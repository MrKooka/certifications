In this lesson, we're going to explore the Characteristics, Capabilities, and Applications of Copper Media. Now, copper media has been the default type of cable used in our network for decades, which in turn has made them an indispensable part of our network infrastructure. So in this lesson, we're going to explore the 802.3 Standard that includes these specifications for Ethernet network protocols and its associated wiring. The 802.3 Standard is a collection of IEE Standards that define the physical layer and data link layer's media access control or MAC for a given wired Ethernet network. Now this 802.3 Standard is commonly used in local area networks and it provides a basis for the operation of that network. Inside of our wired networks, the most common type of cable that we're going to be using is known as a twisted pair cable. Now under the IEEE 802.3 Standard, there are numerous different types of cables Now under the IEEE 802.3 Standard, there are numerous different types of cables that are going to be defined, including copper cables, like twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, twinaxial cables, and direct attach copper, as well as fiber optic cables and their specifications. So in this lesson, let's focus just on the copper cables, including twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, twinaxial cables, and direct attach copper. First, let's discuss twisted pair cables. Now, a twisted pair cable is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purpose of canceling out the electromagnetic interference or EMI from any of the external sources and crosstalk that might occur from neighboring cables. Now, twisted pair cables are the preferred method for transmitting both data and voice signals, and they can be used for both network and telecommunication services. By twisting the cables, the consistency of the data transmission is increased and its susceptibility to noise and interference is going to be reduced. There are two main types of twisted pair cables you need to be aware of. These are unshielded twisted pair cables or UTP and shielded twisted pair cables or STP. Now, unshielded twisted pair cables or UTP cables are the most common type of twisted pair cables that are being used in telecommunications and computer networks. The unshielded twisted pair cable is comprised of pairs of wires that are twisted together without additional shielding being added to that cable. This design makes UTP cables very lightweight, flexible, and cost effective for a variety of different applications, including most of our Ethernet based local area networks. Now, the lack of shielding inside of these cables does make our UTP cables smaller in diameter, easier for us to install, and overall, they're less expensive than shielded alternatives. On the other hand, shielded twisted pair or STP cables are designed with a layer of insulation or shielding made out of copper tape, a conducting polymer or a braided mesh of copper wires. This shielding adds a protective layer against the electromagnetic interference or EMI by allowing the STP cables to more effectively reduce their noise and improve their signal quality. These shielded twisted pair cables are commonly used in environments where there's a high degree of electromagnetic interferon because they can provide us with a more stable and secure network connection. As you can see, the UTP cables are available at a lower cost. They support easier installations and are more suitable for a wide range of common networking applications where electromagnetic interference is not a big concern in our organization. However, UTP cables are more susceptible to EMI and noise, which can then degrade the signal quality over longer distances or in individual environments. To counteract this, you should utilize a shielded twisted pair cable because it offers better protection against interference and crosstalk, This means that the STP cables are a better choice for environments with significant EMI being present, and this can also help us to maintain higher data rates over longer distances than if we're using a UTP cable. Now the biggest downside to using shielded twisted pair cables is that they're more expensive, they're bulkier, and they're more difficult to install due to that additional shielding that's being added into that design. Now, regardless of whether you use a shielded or an unshielded twisted pair cable, each cable will also be categorized using a number such as CAT 5, CAT 5e, CAT 6, CAT 6a, CAT 7, and CAT 8. Let's take a moment and break down each of these different categories in the 802.3 Ethernet standard to better understand their speed and distance limitations. Now, CAT 5 is the oldest category that you're probably still going to run across today out in the real world. CAT 5 cables only support data transfer speeds up to a hundred megabits per second with a maximum cable length of a hundred meters using frequencies of up to 100 megahertz. This type of cable is also referred to as a 100 BASE-T network or under the term fast Ethernet. CAT 5e or category five enhanced is an advancement over this older CAT 5 cable standard. CAT 5e will support data transfer speeds up to 1000 megabits per second, which is also equivalent to one Gigabit per second, and it has a maximum cable length of a hundred meters and uses a frequency of a hundred megahertz. Essentially, a CAT 5e cable contains more twist than the older CAT 5 cable, and this helps to reduce crosstalk as the data is being transmitted over that cable. And this in turn provides us with better signal integrity that allows us to support up to one Gigabit per second of speed instead of only supporting a hundred megabits per second of speed that that CAT 5 cable normally supported. This type of cable is also referred to as a 1000 BASE-T or Gigabit Ethernet connection. As we move into more modern cabling, we find our next category, which is known as CAT Now, CAT 6 cables only support data transfer speeds of up to one Gigabit per second with a maximum cable length of 100 meters using frequencies of up to 250 megahertz. If your cable length is 55 meters or less, then you can also support data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second instead. This type of cable is also referred to as 10G BASE-T when it's used under 55 meters. and supports up to 10 Gigabits per second, and it's also referred to as 10 Gigabit Ethernet. But if you're using it as a hundred meters or less, you're going to refer to this as a 1000 BASE-T just like you did with CAT 5e, and this is going to be used to support a one Gigabit per second connection, and therefore it'll be referred to as Gigabit Ethernet. Next we have CAT 6a. Now CAT 6a is known as category six augmented.  X udemy CAT 6a cables support data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second with a maximum cable length of 100 meters using frequencies up to 500 megahertz. This type of cable is also referred to as 10G BASE- T or 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Basically, CAT 6a has increased the crosstalk protection over a CAT 6 cable, and this means that CAT 6a can support data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second, even as far as a hundred meters, unlike CAT 6, which was limited to 55 meters in length when you want to operate at 10 Gigabits per second. The next cable type we have is CAT 7. CAT 7 cables are not actually recognized by TIA/EIA as a standard, but you're still going to find plenty of devices and cables that do support CAT 7. CAT 7 cables support data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second with a maximum cable or 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks. The final one we have when it comes to CATs is CAT 8. CAT 8 is a modern advanced standard that supports data transfer speeds of up to 40 Gigabits per second with a maximum cable length of only 30 meters, and it uses frequencies up to 2000 megahertz, which is also considered to be two gigahertz in frequency. Now, the CAT 8 cable was designed for use in data centers and enterprise applications where high speed data transfer was crucial and shorter distances such as between two servers inside of a rack or between two neighboring server racks could be used by using CAT 8 cables instead of using a fiber cable. Now the second thing we need to look at is to look at coaxial cables. Now, coaxial cables also known simply as coax, has been a fundamental part of networking and broadcasting for decades. Coaxial cables consist of a single copper conductor at its core with an insulating layer and a conductive shield wrapped around it. Originally, most people were introduced to coaxial cables from their use in broadband systems like cable television systems because these cables could carry numerous television channels into our homes over a single coaxial cable line These days though, these same coaxial cables are also being used to carry data at high speeds over longer distances. In most residential installations, the RG-6 coaxial cable will be used to support faster internet speeds when you're using a cable modem. These RG-6 cables have a heavier center copper core, which makes it great for high bandwidth and higher frequency applications like cable modems and digital video transmission systems. In the old days, there was actually an older standard for coaxial cables known as RG-59, but this isn't commonly used anymore. because it is an inner copper core that's much thinner than an RG-6 cable. And these older RG-59 cables can only really be used in analog video and closed circuit television installations because of their lower bandwidth and lower frequency capabilities. Now, when it comes to coaxial cables, the data transfer speeds associated with an RG-6 coaxial cable really does depend on the specific application you're using, but most modern coaxial cables can support speeds of up to one Gigabit per second at a distance of up to 300 meters. Now, a newer form of coaxial cabling is referred to as direct attach copper or DAC cables. Direct attach copper cables are a form of fixed assembly copper cabling that's used to connect switches, routers, firewalls, and servers, and they're primarily used within server racks inside of a data center or within close range of your network infrastructure's hardware. These direct attach copper cables come with connectors already attach when you purchase them, and they're really favored for their cost effectiveness and reduced power consumption as compared to fiber optics when they're used for short distances. Direct attach cables can operate at a maximum data speed of a hundred Gigabits per second at 15 meters or less when using an active cable or 100 Gigabits per second at seven meters. or less when you're using passive cables. These direct attach cables can also support high speed data transmissions with speeds of 10 Gigabits per second, 40 Gigabits per second, or up to a hundred Gigabits per second depending on the distance being covered, and this makes them well suited for interconnect applications between two servers, routers, switches, or other devices. Another coaxial cable you may hear mentioned is what we refer to as a twinaxial cable Now, a twinaxial cable is often a component of a direct attach copper assembly, and it's considered another specialized form of cabling. Unlike a traditional coaxial cable, a twinaxial cable consists of two separate insulated copper conductors that are run parallel within the same outer shield. This twinaxial cable design is optimized for short range, high speed differential signaling applications. Twinaxial cables are commonly used for SFP+, which is a small form factor pluggable plus or QSFP, which is a quad small form factor pluggable direct attach application between two different routers or switches. These twinaxial cables provide a reliable solution for high frequency transmissions and offer superior signal integrity over shorter distances. As compared to a traditional unshielded cable, twinaxial cables are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference, which is a significant advantage in tightly packed data centers where signal interference can become a major issue for your network. These twinaxial cables can support data transfer speeds of 10 Gigabits per second, 25 Gigabits per second, 40 Gigabits per second, or 100 Gigabits per second at a distance of up to 100 meters for the 10 Gigabit per second cables, or as short as seven meters for the 100 Gigabit per second cables. The last thing we need to discuss is the difference between plenum and non-plenum cables. Now, plenum cables are designed with fire-retardant plastic jackets that are made from materials such as PVC or FEP PVC is poly vinyl chloride, and FEP is Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene This is used to prevent flames from spreading and reduces the amount of smoke produced during the fire of those cables. These characteristics are essential for the cables that run in the plenum spaces of our buildings, which are those areas typically used to route air circulating for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Since these spaces have an abundant supply of oxygen and can facilitate the rapid spread of fire, these cables that are installed here must adhere to strict fire safety standards, and that's why we use plenum-rated cables because these plenum-rated cables meet the stringent requirements of the National Fire Protection Association. and the National Electrical Code. Although they are more expensive, their use is critical in minimizing the risks associated with fire and smoke in building spaces where air circulation can occur outside of your duct work. Now, non-plenum cables. on the other hand, are what we use most of the time in our home office networks. Non-plenum cables are not designed with the same stringent fire-retardant properties. and therefore they're not suitable for use in plenum spaces. Typically, these cables have jackets made from less expensive materials that do not have enhanced fire-resistant characteristics of those plenum-rated cables. These non-plenum cables are typically used in spaces where there's no environmental air between walls, in conduit, and in other areas where the potential for fire to propagate through open air spaces is much lower While they're more cost effective than plenum cables, they do produce more smoke and toxic fumes when they're exposed to flame, and this makes them a really bad choice for any areas that could contribute to the spread of fire throughout a building. For installations that don't require the stringent fire safety standards of plenum-rated cables though, non-plenum cables provide a practical and economical solution for us to use. Now remember, there are a few different ways for US to categorize our copper cables. First, we can categorize them as either twisted pair or coaxial. Then if we're looking at twisted pair cables, we classify them as either shielded or unshielded twisted pair, and then we assign them a CAT number like CAT 5. CAT 5e, CAT 6, CAT 6a, CAT 7, or CAT 8. Then we finally can classify them as either being plenum or non-plenum-rated cables. On the other hand, if we're categorizing our cable as coaxial cable, we can then determine if it's a standard coaxial cable, a direct attach copper cable or a twinaxial cable to best classify its capabilities, limitations and use cases. When it comes to copper media, it's important that you remember the basic speed and distance for each type of cable. So let's review those one more time before we end this lesson. CAT 5 cables can go 100 meters at 100 megabits per second. CAT 5e cables can go 100 meters at one Gigabit per second. CAT 6 cables can go 100 meters at one Gigabit per second, or 55 meters at 10 Gigabits per second. CAT 6a cables can do 100 meters at 10 Gigabits per second. CAT 7 cables can do 100 meters at 10 Gigabits per second, and CAT 8 cables can do about 30 meters at 25 to 40 Gigabits per second. Now, as a quick reminder, all these CAT cables are limited to a hundred meters in length except for CAT 6, which is limited to 55 meters, if you want to provide the maximum speed of 10 Gigabits per second and CAT 8, which is limited to 30 meters. When it comes to speed, you can start with CAT 5 at 100 megabits per second and then step up by a factor of 10 as you move up the scale So CAT 5 is 100 megabits per second, but CAT 5e is 1000 megabits per second, which is also written as one Gigabit per second. CAT 6 is either one Gigabit per second, like CAT Бе, or you can reach 10 Gigabits per second with a cable at 55 meters or less, which again increases by a factor of 10 in terms of speed. CAT 6a is always going to be 10 Gigabits per second, which is 10 times higher than CAT 5e and CAT 6 with that longer 100 meter cable. And CAT 7 will remain at 10 Gigabits per second, just like CAT 6. But then when we go to CAT 8, it increases again, but this time it goes from 10 Gigabits per second to 25 or 40 Gigabits per second depending on that cable length. On the coaxial cable side, you'll find that a traditional RG-6 coaxial cable can support speeds of up to one Gigabit per second added length of around 300 meters. Twinaxial cables have a much shorter distance of only 10 meters, but it does support much higher speeds by going up to 10 Gigabits per second or more. Direct attach cables are the newest and most modern copper cable type, and they support speeds of up to 100 Gigabits per second at a distance of 15 meters for active cables and only up to a distance of seven meters for passive cables at 100 Gigabits per second. Now, I know that was a ton of facts and figures, and I do recommend that you take a little time offline to study these numbers from your notes because they will be important during your troubleshooting and network design work as a network technician out in the real world. Even though much of the world is slowly moving over to fiber, copper media will remain a vital part of our network infrastructure for years to come because it provides us with a versatility and robustness required for various networking needs at a lower price and is much easier to install and maintain for many applications and workplace environments than fiber is.
