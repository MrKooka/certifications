### **802.3 Standard Overview**:

The **802.3 Standard**, developed by IEEE, defines the **physical layer** and **data link layer's Media Access Control (MAC)** for **Ethernet networks**. It primarily covers:

1. **Ethernet specifications**: Speed, cabling, and signaling.
2. **Cable types**: Twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic.
3. **Protocols**: Rules for data transmission and addressing in Ethernet networks.

### **Terms Related to 802.3**:

The following terms directly fall under or are part of the **802.3 Standard**:

- **2. [[MAC (Media Access Control)]]**: Defined by the 802.3 Standard for Ethernet.
- **3. Twisted Pair Cable**: Includes specifications for UTP and STP under 802.3.
- **6. UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**: Commonly used for Ethernet (e.g., CAT 5, CAT 6).
- **7. STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**: Also defined for specific use cases.
- **8. CAT Cables**: Categories like CAT 5, CAT 6, and CAT 8 align with Ethernet standards.
- **16. Base-T (e.g., 100 BASE-T)**: Refers to Ethernet standards within 802.3.

### **Terms NOT Fully Defined by 802.3**:

These terms are more general or fall outside the 802.3 Standard:

- **4. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**: General issue for all cables, not specific to 802.3.
- **5. Crosstalk**: Related to cable design, not explicitly an 802.3 specification.
- **9. Coaxial Cable (Coax)**: While some coaxial Ethernet (e.g., 10BASE5) was once part of 802.3, coax is now mostly used in other contexts like cable TV.
- **10. RG-6 and RG-59**: Cable specifications used in broadcasting, not 802.3-specific.
- **11. Direct Attach Copper (DAC)**: Used in data centers, not officially under 802.3.
- **12. Twinaxial Cable**: Often used in specific high-speed interfaces, not part of 802.3.
- **13. SFP+ and QSFP**: Hardware interfaces for high-speed networking, not 802.3-specific.
- **14. Plenum Cable**: Refers to fire safety standards, not Ethernet-specific.
- **15. Non-Plenum Cable**: Same as above, related to installation environments.

### Summary:

- Many terms (**MAC**, **twisted pair cables**, **CAT cables**, **Base-T**) are directly defined by the **802.3 Standard**.
- Some terms (**coaxial cables, DAC, twinaxial cables, plenum cables**) are related to networking but not strictly governed by **802.3**.
- **802.3 Standard** is primarily focused on **Ethernet networking**, and not all cabling or hardware concepts fall within its scope.
