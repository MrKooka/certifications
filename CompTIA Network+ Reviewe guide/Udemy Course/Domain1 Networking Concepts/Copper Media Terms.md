### Summary:

Copper media plays a vital role in network infrastructure, providing versatile and cost-effective cabling solutions for various applications. Key types include **twisted pair cables**, such as **UTP** (unshielded) for general use and **STP** (shielded) for environments with high electromagnetic interference (EMI). Twisted pair cables are categorized into performance classes like **CAT 5**, **CAT 6**, and **CAT 8**, each supporting different speeds and distances.

**Coaxial cables**, like **RG-6**, are used for data and video transmission, while newer **Direct Attach Copper (DAC)** cables and **Twinaxial cables** support high-speed connections within data centers. Copper cabling can also be classified as **plenum** or **non-plenum**, depending on fire safety requirements.

Understanding the capabilities and limitations of each cable type is essential for network design and troubleshooting, especially when choosing between copper and alternatives like fiber optic cables. Despite advancements, copper remains a robust and cost-efficient solution for many networking needs.
