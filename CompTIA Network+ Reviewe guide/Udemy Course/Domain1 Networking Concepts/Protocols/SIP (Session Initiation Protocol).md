#### **Purpose**:

- Used to establish, modify, and terminate multimedia communication sessions, such as voice and video calls.

#### **How It Works**:

- SIP messages are exchanged to set up and manage sessions:
    1. **Invite**: Starts a session.
    2. **BYE**: Ends a session.
    3. **ACK**: Acknowledges requests.
- Works with other protocols like **RTP (Real-Time Protocol)** for the actual media transfer.

#### **Uses**:

- Powers Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, video conferencing, and instant messaging.

#### **Ports**:

- Typically uses **TCP/UDP port 5060** or **5061** (for secure SIP over TLS).
