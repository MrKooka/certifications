### **1. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**

- **Usability (2024)**: ★★★★★ (5/5)
- **Why?**:
    - IMAP is the most widely used protocol for **retrieving and managing emails** in modern email systems.
    - Supports synchronization between the server and multiple devices, making it ideal for today’s multi-device world (smartphones, tablets, PCs).
    - Allows users to organize email folders and access them directly on the server.
    - **Encryption**: Modern implementations use SSL/TLS or STARTTLS for secure communication.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, and other web-based services heavily rely on IMAP for email retrieval.

### **2. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

- **Usability (2024)**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Why?**:
    - SMTP remains the **standard protocol for sending emails** and is universally supported across email systems.
    - Paired with IMAP or POP3 for complete email communication (sending via SMTP, retrieving via IMAP/POP3).
    - SMTP has evolved with modern encryption (STARTTLS, SSL/TLS) to ensure secure email transmission.
    - While essential for email delivery, SMTP by itself doesn’t support email retrieval, which limits its direct usability for end-users.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Back-end email servers, transactional emails, and client-server communication.

### **3. POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3)**

- **Usability (2024)**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
- **Why?**:
    - POP3 is outdated compared to IMAP. It lacks multi-device synchronization and advanced features like folder management.
    - Typically deletes emails from the server after downloading (unless configured otherwise), making it less suitable for modern workflows.
    - Still functional in basic setups but is rarely the default choice for modern email clients.
    - **Legacy Use**: Small businesses or personal setups with single-device access may still use POP3 for simplicity.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Legacy email systems or minimal setups without synchronization needs.

### Overall Ranking:

1. **IMAP**: Best choice for modern email retrieval and management due to its synchronization and advanced features.
2. **SMTP**: Essential for sending emails but not directly used by end-users for retrieval or management.
3. **POP3**: Suitable for limited use cases but largely replaced by IMAP in modern email workflows.

If you’re configuring an email system or learning for an exam like **CompTIA Network+**, focus primarily on **IMAP** and **SMTP**, as these protocols are most relevant in current and future contexts.
