## Overview
**Coaxial cable** (commonly called **coax**) is a type of copper cable designed for high-frequency signal transmission. It consists of a central conductor, insulation, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer, offering excellent protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI).

## Structure
1. **Central Conductor**: Made of copper or copper-clad aluminum for signal transmission.
2. **Insulating Layer**: Surrounds the central conductor to prevent signal leakage.
3. **Metallic Shield**: A braided or foil shield that reduces EMI and crosstalk.
4. **Outer Jacket**: Protects the cable and provides durability.

## Types of Coaxial Cables
1. **RG-6**:
   - Heavier center conductor.
   - Supports high-bandwidth applications (e.g., cable TV, broadband internet).
   - Commonly used in residential and commercial installations.
2. **RG-59**:
   - Thinner central conductor compared to RG-6.
   - Suitable for analog video and TV applications.
   - Limited bandwidth and lower frequency capabilities.
   - isn's commonly used anymore 
1. **Twinaxial Cable**:
   - Contains two insulated copper conductors in parallel within the same shield.
   - Used for high-speed differential signaling in data centers (e.g., SFP+, QSFP applications).

## Applications
1. **Telecommunications**:
   - Broadband internet (e.g., connecting cable modems).
   - Cable television.
2. **Networking**:
   - Supports data transmission at distances up to 300 meters for 1 Gbps with RG-6.
   - Twinaxial cables used in high-speed interconnects between servers, routers, and switches.
3. **Video Transmission**:
   - Analog and digital video delivery in CCTV systems and home theater setups.

## Advantages
- Excellent resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- Supports high-speed data transmission over longer distances than unshielded cables.
- Durable and reliable in outdoor or high-EMI environments.

## Limitations
- Bulky and less flexible compared to twisted pair cables.
- Higher cost for long runs.
- Limited scalability for future high-speed networking needs (compared to fiber optics).

## Coaxial Cable Variants
1. **Direct Attach Copper (DAC)**:
   - Pre-terminated coax cables for connecting devices in data centers.
   - Supports speeds up to 100 Gbps at short distances (15 meters or less for active cables).
2. **Plenum-Rated Coaxial Cable**:
   - Fire-resistant coating for use in building plenum spaces.

## Key Characteristics
- **Impedance**: Typically 50 ohms (for data) or 75 ohms (for video).
- **Bandwidth**: Depends on type; RG-6 supports high frequencies for broadband and cable TV.
- **Length**: RG-6 coaxial cables can transmit data up to 300 meters, while twinaxial cables are optimized for shorter distances (10â€“100 meters).

## Comparison with Other Media
- **Twisted Pair Cables**: Coax offers better EMI resistance but is bulkier and less flexible.
- **Fiber Optics**: Coax is more affordable but has lower bandwidth and longer transmission limitations.
