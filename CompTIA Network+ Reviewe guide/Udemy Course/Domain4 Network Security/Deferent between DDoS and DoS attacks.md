### **DoS (Denial of Service) Attack**

A **DoS attack** comes from **a single source** (one computer or network).

- The attacker overwhelms the target system (server, website, or network) with traffic or requests.
- Goal: Make the target slow, unresponsive, or unavailable.

#### Characteristics of DoS:

1. **Single Origin**: The attack comes from one machine or IP address.
2. **Easier to Trace**: Since it's a single source, detecting and blocking it is simpler.
3. **Limited Scale**: One machine has limited bandwidth and power, so the attack volume is smaller.

#### Example:

A single computer floods a web server with ICMP (ping) requests.

### **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack**

A **DDoS attack** comes from **multiple sources** (a network of compromised machines, called a botnet).

- The attacker uses many devices (computers, IoT devices) to send a flood of requests to the target.
- Goal: Overwhelm the target system on a much larger scale.

#### Characteristics of DDoS:

1. **Multiple Origins**: The attack comes from many machines across different locations.
2. **Harder to Trace**: Since it involves many IP addresses, identifying and blocking attackers is difficult.
3. **Massive Scale**: DDoS attacks can generate enormous traffic that overwhelms even robust systems.

#### Example:

Thousands of compromised devices (botnet) simultaneously flood a web server with HTTP requests.

### Key Differences:

|**Aspect**|**DoS Attack**|**DDoS Attack**|
|---|---|---|
|**Source**|Single device or network|Multiple devices (botnet)|
|**Attack Scale**|Smaller, easier to block|Larger, harder to block|
|**Complexity**|Simple to execute|Requires more coordination|
|**Detection**|Easier to detect and mitigate|Harder due to distributed traffic|
|**Tools Used**|Single tool (e.g., ping flood)|Botnets, malware-infected devices|

### Analogy:

- **DoS**: Like one person shouting loudly to disrupt a class.
- **DDoS**: Like a crowd of thousands shouting at once, making it impossible to stop.
