### OSI Model Overview

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication into **7 layers**. It helps guide network protocols and troubleshooting by dividing the communication process into manageable parts. Below are the 7 layers with links to each:

1. [[Physical Layer]] - Manages the physical transmission of data through hardware components like cables and switches.
2. [[Data Link Layer]] - Ensures reliable data transfer between devices using MAC addresses and error detection.
3. [[Network Layer]] - Handles routing of data across different networks using logical addressing (IP addresses).
4. [[Transport Layer]] - Manages data flow control, error checking, and provides reliable communication between hosts (e.g., TCP/UDP).
5. [[Session Layer (Layer 5)|Session Layer]] - Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices.
6. [[Presentation Layer (Layer 6)|Presentation Layer ]] - Translates, encrypts, and compresses data for compatibility between applications.
7. [[Application Layer (Layer 7)]] - Provides services for network applications like email, file transfer, and web browsing.

Each layer has a specific function and works with the layers above and below it to facilitate communication.

You can copy this into your Obsidian vault, and as you create each linked note (e.g., "Physical Layer"), you can dive deeper into the specifics of each layer. This approach helps build interconnected knowledge, which is essential for the Zettelkasten method.
