### Session Layer (Layer 5)

The **Session Layer** is the **5th layer** of the **OSI Model** and is responsible for **establishing, managing, and terminating sessions** between devices. It provides mechanisms for maintaining connections and ensuring that data is synchronized and organized between applications during communication.

**Key Functions**:
- **Session Establishment**: Sets up and initiates communication sessions between devices or applications.
- **Session Maintenance**: Keeps track of data exchange and manages synchronization and recovery in case of disruptions.
- **Session Termination**: Closes sessions after communication is complete or when sessions need to be ended abruptly.

**Examples**:
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**: Manages the sessions for executing commands on remote systems.
- **NetBIOS**: A protocol for establishing sessions between Windows-based systems.
- **Session-based Communication**: Supports services like video conferencing or remote desktop sessions.

**Related Layers**:
- [[Presentation Layer]] (Layer 6) - Formats and translates data during the session.
- [[Transport Layer]] (Layer 4) - Provides reliable or unreliable delivery of data packets that the session layer coordinates.

The Session Layer plays a crucial role in maintaining the **state** and **order** of communications, ensuring applications work seamlessly during multi-step transactions.
