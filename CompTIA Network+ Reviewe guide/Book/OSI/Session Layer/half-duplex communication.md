**Half-duplex communication** is a mode of communication where data transmission can occur in **both directions**, but **not simultaneously**. In a half-duplex system, devices take turns to send and receive information, meaning only one device can transmit at a time, while the other device listens. It allows for two-way communication, but it is **one-way at any given moment**.

### Characteristics of Half-Duplex Communication:
- **Two-Way, One-at-a-Time**: Data can flow in both directions, but only one party can transmit at a time. The other party must wait until the transmission is complete before responding.
- **More Efficient Than Simplex**: Since both devices can communicate (albeit not simultaneously), it is more interactive than simplex communication.
- **Less Complex Than Full-Duplex**: It does not require the hardware complexity needed to allow simultaneous transmission and reception.

### Examples of Half-Duplex Communication:
- **Walkie-Talkies**: Users take turns speaking; when one person speaks, the other must wait before replying.
- **Traditional Ethernet Networks (using hubs)**: Data can be sent and received, but only one device can transmit data on the network at a time to avoid collisions.
- **Two-Way Radios**: Communication happens one way at a time; the speaker must finish before the other party can respond.

### Comparison:
- **Simplex**: One-way only.
- **Half-Duplex**: Two-way, but one direction at a time.
- **Full-Duplex**: Two-way, both directions simultaneously.

In summary, **half-duplex communication** allows devices to communicate in both directions, but they cannot do so at the same time. Each device must wait for the other to finish transmitting before it can start sending data.
