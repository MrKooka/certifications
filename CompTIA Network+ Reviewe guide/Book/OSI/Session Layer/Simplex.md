**Simplex** is a mode of communication where data is transmitted in **one direction only**. In simplex communication, information flows from the sender to the receiver, but the receiver cannot send any information back. It is a **one-way communication** method, making it different from **half-duplex** or **full-duplex** modes, where data can flow in both directions.

### Examples of Simplex Communication:
- **Television Broadcast**: The signal is sent from the broadcasting station to the television, but the TV cannot send information back to the station.
- **Radio Broadcast**: The radio station transmits audio signals, and listeners receive them without being able to respond.
- **Keyboard**: When you type, the keyboard sends signals to the computer, but it does not receive any data back from the computer.

### Characteristics of Simplex:
- **One-way Transmission**: Data flows in only one direction â€” from sender to receiver.
- **No Feedback Mechanism**: The receiver cannot acknowledge or respond to the sender.
- **Often Used for Broadcast Systems**: Simplex is efficient for scenarios where only sending data is necessary, such as broadcasting information or sending control signals.

In summary, **simplex** is a communication method where data is transmitted in a single, unidirectional flow without any capability for two-way interaction.
