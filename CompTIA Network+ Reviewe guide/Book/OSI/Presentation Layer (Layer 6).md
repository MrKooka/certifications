### Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

The **Presentation Layer** is the **6th layer** of the **OSI Model** and acts as a **translator** between the network and application layers. Its main role is to ensure that the data being transmitted is in a format that the receiving application can understand, handling tasks such as **data translation**, **encryption/decryption**, and **compression**.

**Key Functions**:
- **Data Translation**: Converts data formats (e.g., character encoding like ASCII to EBCDIC).
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Secures data by encrypting it before transmission and decrypting it upon receipt.
- **Compression/Decompression**: Optimizes data size for efficient transmission, reducing bandwidth usage.

**Examples**:
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypts web traffic for secure communication (e.g., HTTPS).
- **JPEG/PNG**: Formats used for image compression and rendering.
- **MPEG/MP3**: Formats for audio and video compression.

**Related Layers**:
- [[Session Layer]] (Layer 5) - Manages and maintains the session where the data is exchanged.
- [[Application Layer (Layer 7)]] (Layer 7) - Interfaces with applications that use the data processed by the Presentation Layer.

The Presentation Layer ensures that data is formatted correctly and securely, providing compatibility and efficiency across different systems and applications.
