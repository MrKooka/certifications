The packets you shared show the sequence of a **TCP connection** and an **HTTP exchange** between your host (`172.16.1.206`) and the server (`93.184.215.14`). Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

---

### **1. TCP Handshake (Establishing the Connection)**

TCP establishes a reliable connection between the client (your host) and the server before any data is exchanged.

- **Packet 1 (SYN)**:  
    Your host sends a **SYN (synchronize)** packet to the server to initiate the connection.
    
    - Flags: `S` (synchronize).
    - Source Port: 56381 (random port chosen by the client).
    - Destination Port: 80 (HTTP).
- **Packet 2 (SYN-ACK)**:  
    The server responds with a **SYN-ACK** packet, indicating it acknowledges the request and is ready to establish the connection.
    
    - Flags: `SA` (synchronize + acknowledge).
- **Packet 3 (ACK)**:  
    Your host replies with an **ACK** packet to confirm the connection.
    
    - Flags: `A` (acknowledge).

At this point, the **TCP handshake** is complete, and the connection is established.

### **2. HTTP Request (Client Sends Data)**

Once the TCP connection is established, your host sends the **HTTP request**:

- **Packet 4 (HTTP Request, GET)**:  
    Your host sends an HTTP GET request to retrieve a resource (e.g., a webpage).
    - Flags: `PA` (push + acknowledge), indicating that the packet contains data.
    - Application Layer (Raw): Shows the HTTP request content:
        
        ```
        GET / HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        User-Agent: python-requests/2.31.0
        ...
        ```
        

---

### **3. HTTP Response (Server Sends Data)**

The server processes the request and responds with the requested resource:

- **Packet 5 (ACK)**:  
    The server acknowledges the receipt of the GET request.
    
    - Flags: `A` (acknowledge).
- **Packet 6 (HTTP Response)**:  
    The server sends the HTTP response, which includes the requested content (e.g., an HTML file).
    
    - Flags: `PA` (push + acknowledge).
    - Application Layer (Raw): Shows the HTTP response headers and body:
        
        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Encoding: gzip
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
        ...
        ```
        

---

### **4. TCP Teardown (Closing the Connection)**

After the data exchange is complete, the TCP connection is terminated:

- **Packet 7 (FIN)**:  
    Your host sends a **FIN (finish)** packet to indicate it wants to close the connection.
    
    - Flags: `FA` (finish + acknowledge).
- **Packet 8 (FIN-ACK)**:  
    The server responds with a **FIN-ACK** packet, acknowledging the request to close the connection.
    
    - Flags: `FA` (finish + acknowledge).
- **Packet 9 (ACK)**:  
    Your host sends a final **ACK** packet to confirm the connection is closed.
    
    - Flags: `A` (acknowledge).

---

### **Sequence Overview**

The entire conversation follows this order:

1. **TCP Handshake**:
    - SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
2. **HTTP Exchange**:
    - Client sends `GET` (HTTP request).
    - Server responds with `200 OK` (HTTP response).
3. **TCP Teardown**:
    - FIN → FIN-ACK → ACK.

This process repeats each time you make a new HTTP request to the server.

---

### **Why This Happens Every Time?**

- **Connection-oriented nature of TCP**:  
    Each HTTP request/response pair requires a TCP connection to ensure reliable data delivery.
- **Statelessness of HTTP**:  
    HTTP itself is stateless, meaning each request is independent. Even if you're fetching multiple resources (e.g., images, scripts), a new TCP handshake is often initiated unless HTTP keep-alive is used.
