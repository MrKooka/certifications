**Prompt for CompTIA Network+ Exam Preparation with Zettelkasten Notes in Obsidian:**

---

**Objective:** Create a structured set of notes in Obsidian for topics related to the CompTIA Network+ exam, utilizing the Zettelkasten method for effective information management and retrieval.

**Instructions:**

1. **Topic Selection:**
   - Identify a specific topic from the CompTIA Network+ exam objectives (e.g., OSI Model, IP Addressing, Network Security).
   - Clearly state the topic title as the main header in your note.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - List key concepts and definitions relevant to the topic in bullet points.
   - Ensure clarity and conciseness in each definition to facilitate quick understanding.

3. **Zettelkasten Connections:**
   - Create unique identifiers for each note (e.g., 2023-10-01-OSI-Model).
   - Link this note to related notes in your Obsidian vault (e.g., linking "OSI Model" to "TCP/IP Model" and "Network Protocols").
   - Include a section at the end of the note labeled "Related Notes" where these links can be easily accessed.

4. **Personal Insights:**
   - Add a section for personal reflections or insights on the topic. This could include:
     - Why the topic is important.
     - How it relates to real-world applications.
     - Any study strategies that work well for you.

5. **Visual Aids:**
   - If applicable, create diagrams or flowcharts using Obsidianâ€™s markdown features to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Label these visuals clearly and reference them within the text.

6. **Review Questions:**
   - Draft 3-5 review questions based on the content of the note to test your understanding and retention.
   - Format these questions as a bullet list under a section titled "Review Questions."

7. **Further Reading:**
   - Suggest resources for further reading or study materials, including textbooks, online courses, or videos related to the topic.

8. **Regular Updates:**
   - Schedule regular reviews of this note to incorporate new information or insights as you continue your exam preparation.

**Format Example:**
